Final Version: Consider this version for final evaluation.

The Submission Folder contains :

1. Interfaced folder     -> This folder is the one to be considered for a complete overview of the project. Just go to the folder and execute "python Launch.py" and the launched GUI will guide you as it is pretty self explanatory.
 
2. Non_Interfaced folder -> This contains the two non-interfaced submissioms. Go to this folder and execute:
			    (i)  'python GrahamScanVisualization.py n', where n is an integer which denotes the number of inputs you want to 					  give. This file will then generate n random points and show the visualization.
			    (ii) 'python GrahamScanVisualizationGraphInput.py n', where n is an integer which denotes the number of inputs you 					  want to give. This file will then open up a plot and allow you to choose points on the plot and then 					  generate the visualization.

3. Visualizations folder -> This contains two sub-folders :
			    (i)  ReportImages -> This contains the visualizations included in the report.
		            (ii) NonInterfaced_OutputGifs -> This contains the final gifs from the non-interfaced submissions.	 

4. CompGeo_ProjReport    -> A Technical Report  detailing the methodology and the time comparisons for the algorithms.
